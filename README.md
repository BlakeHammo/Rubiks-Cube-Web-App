# 3D Rubiks Cube Web App 
Personal Web Application Project

## Installation
As the app is still a work in progress, I've not utilissed a build tool yet. Therefore we need to ensure both three.js and vite are installed
```bash
npm install --save three
npm install --save-dev vite
```

## Usage
We run vite from the terminal window
```bash
npx vite
```
Pressing "o + enter" will then open the application in the browser.
For a list of other commands to use with vite, press "h + enter".
